# CatQuestipedia is a passion project with the goal of creating a good source of information on the Cat Quest franchise.
# I was inspired to start this project when I saw the atrocious state of the current source of information at fandom.com. 
# I am currently trying to focus on the coding aspects, particularly getting the content on the pages, adding functionality, and general styling.
# It is not currently a wiki, so adding information from the games is quite slow.
# Given my current project structure, I am not sure how to turn it into a wiki. 
# If I can figure it out, I hope to add a section for "User Added Content", where users can add content that doesn't fit in the database structure.
# So far, all users can do is create playthroughs and track their completion level in each playthrough.
# Other functionality includes a light mode and dark mode.
